## What we will cover?

* What is imperadive programming? and What is declarative programming?

Imperative programming is that we write codes to tell the web applications what we want to do, including insert, manipulate in a particular way, etc. On the other hand, declarative programming is that what we want to our application look like! Or how the application should work. And React is used to take care of figuring out what the application should do in order to make the look that what we want initially. 

In particular, to achieve that goal, there are number of tools that React is going to use. The first is JSX.

* What is JSX?

In JSX, we can treat html elements as the value like string, function, array, etc. For instance, <code>const foo = <h1>Heelo World!</h1></code>
